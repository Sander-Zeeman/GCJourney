# GC Journey

This repo will describe my journey through Computer Graphics in OpenGL.
Every major new feature I discover will be placed in a new folder.
I took a single course in Computer Graphics back in the start of 2021,
but most of the things I learned there have long since left my memory.
In this journey, I'll be using OpenGL and SDL2, entirely in C.

Note, from 2- onwards, cmake will be used instead of scripts, as the programs became longer than a single c file.
